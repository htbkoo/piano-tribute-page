# piano-tribute-page

A tribute page for piano with parallax effect. 

### Background

Originally it was hosted on [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/htbkoo) but the parallax effect was not fully working on CodePen. 

And the source files were checked in to the [Javascript repo](https://github.com/htbkoo/javascript/tree/master/src/main/javascript/online/free_code_camp/basic_front_end_development_projects/build_a_tribute_page) but I found that it is easier to manage with a standalone repo. 

It is one of the project in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
